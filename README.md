#### ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING EXERCISE
- [x] Create an image and set the following attributes with Vue {src, alt, title}

### vue_2.html
- [x] Read Code Above
- [x] Will the span have values for special and important? -> Yes
- [x] execute the code and interpret!
      * The values for special and important are included because both of them are defined as true in either in v-bind or in data object.

#### ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING EXERCISE

- [x] Change "isSpecial" and "isImportant" so they are randomly assigned a Truthy or Falsey value


### vue_3.html
- [x] Read Code Above
- [x] Does the profile show up? -> No, because there are no values assigned for the profile yet.

#### ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING EXERCISE

#### ASYNCHRONOUS LEARNING EXERCISE
